# GIF decoder
Allow using GIF images in LVGL. Based on https://github.com/lecram/gifdec

When enabled in `lv_conf.h` with `LV_USE_GIF` `lv_gif_create(parent)` can be used to create a gif widget.

`lv_gif_set_src(obj, src)` works very similarly to `lv_img_set_src`. As source, it also accepts images as variables (`lv_img_dsc_t`) or files.
