Node identifiers
****************

To get information about a particular devicetree node, you need a *node
identifier* for it. This is a just a C macro that refers to the node.

These are the main ways to get a node identifier:

By node label
   Use :c:func:`DT_NODELABEL()` to get a node identifier from a :ref:`node
   label <dt-node-labels>`. Node labels are often provided by SoC :file:`.dtsi`
   files to give nodes names that match the SoC datasheet, like ``i2c1``,
   ``spi2``, etc.

By alias
   Use :c:func:`DT_ALIAS()` to get a node identifier for a property of the
   special ``/aliases`` node. This is sometimes done by applications (like
   :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`, which uses the ``led0`` alias) that need to
   refer to *some* device of a particular type ("the board's user LED") but
   don't care which one is used.

Two node identifiers which refer to the same node are identical and can be used
interchangeably.
