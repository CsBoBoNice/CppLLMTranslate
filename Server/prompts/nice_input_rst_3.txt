.. _dt-node-main-ex:

Here's a DTS fragment for some imaginary hardware we'll return to throughout
this file for examples:

.. literalinclude:: main-example.dts
   :language: devicetree
   :start-after: start-after-here

Here are a few ways to get node identifiers for the ``i2c@40002000`` node:

- ``DT_PATH(soc, i2c_40002000)``
- ``DT_NODELABEL(i2c1)``
- ``DT_ALIAS(sensor_controller)``
- ``DT_INST(x, vnd_soc_i2c)`` for some unknown number ``x``. See the
  :c:func:`DT_INST()` documentation for details.

.. important::

   Non-alphanumeric characters like dash (``-``) and the at sign (``@``) in
   devicetree names are converted to underscores (``_``). The names in a DTS
   are also converted to lowercase.
