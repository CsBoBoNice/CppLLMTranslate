Devicetree access from C/C++
############################

This guide describes Zephyr's ``<zephyr/devicetree.h>`` API for reading the
devicetree from C source files. It assumes you're familiar with the concepts in
:ref:`devicetree-intro` and :ref:`dt-bindings`. See :ref:`dt-reference` for
reference material.

A note for Linux developers
***************************

Linux developers familiar with devicetree should be warned that the API
described here differs significantly from how devicetree is used on Linux.
